	<book id="MasterOfTheMoon" title="Master of the Moon (Pisces)">
		<page>To all men who call themselves children of this planet - hark! What is contained in this treatise is of utmost relevance to you and your kin, the great grandchildren of the Universe.</page>
		<page>Above our own heads, the Master of the Moon looms. He sends forth all manner of strange beasts who would trample and crawl upon the earth, if not for the protection that our firmament provides.</page>
		<page>Should the strength of our firmament fail - which is not entirely out of the question (see On the Firmament) - our eyes would be shut such that we dream of all things vile and cruel.</page>

	<book id="NullAndNan" title="On Null and Nan">

		<page>Should Null and Nan lay their hands on the same object at once, the object can be made to be unexistent.</page>

	<book id="blinder" title="On the Blinder">
		<page>His horrorific visage caused me momentary blindness, such that I could not see him. This is his only mercy.</page>
